version 0.0.2.
changed the overall difficulty by making asteroids go faster at the start
the ship now uses more energy when the thruster is burned
now pressing the F3 key will reset the game
show the copyright screen when we hit fire in the attract screen
also show the copyright screen when the game is powered on
added --monochrome and --inverted-mono command line options
added support for changing volume levels in test mode
no longer showing the mouse cursor -- it is now invisible

fixed bugs:
in freeplay, now resetting ship to be stationary and at the center of the screen at game start.
now resetting bonus at game start so it doesn't persist from attract screen.
now not crashing when we start a game on `quiet' and view the copyright screen.
