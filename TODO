pausing and then unpausing turns on thruster sound?

no regeneration happening on bonuses that are completely destroyed.

when the ship dies and it's game over, and then the last asteroid goes through the bottom, the game over screen is short-circuited.

maybe not collect points while the ship is flashing red/white reincarnating.


crashed on challenging stage and it said 100 points for not crashing.
  died right at the end
